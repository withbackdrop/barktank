       QUERY: Given the pitch which is the context and who you are, follow the rules below:
       - Start by giving your overall feedback. You should mention at least 1 thing you like and then the things you do not like. Be very moody and flamboyant with your feedback!
       - Next ask a critical question about the pitch.
       - You should end with a probability to invest, which should be between 0% - 100%. Using your own opinion to decide how much you are likely to invest in this project. If you give a probability of 80% of more, this means you want to invest in that project.\n
